At the point when hardware fails to function you know what you miss. It's not just the backup. You loose precious time. From one of my customers I got a company notebook to be able to work in his corporate intranet and access all needed servers. Without it I can develop with pen and paper. This notebook is a HP/Compaq NC8000 with Win2000 on it- it worked very reliably over the last years. On Monday I put it into standby mode. When I tried to start it yesterday the fan was on for about 10 seconds, the LED with the flash symbol came up (I never saw this one, I thought it was broken :) ) and nothing more happened. Just imagin a deadline within the next 3 days and you know about my feelings. I removed the battery and tried various combinations to breath live back into this dead piece of silicon and plastic. Nothing worked. So in a very sad mood I went to the technicians of that company. They repeated the exact same sequence of trial starts- with battery only, with battery and wire and finally wire only. This one brought it back to life! That's unfair, I thought. I felt a bit stupid. But anyway, I was very happy to be able to continue my work. Until today. While in a [VM Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/) session and hacking some fancy perl stuff suddenly the display went black and nothing happened anymore. Same as yesterday. With the exception that I did not yet get the machine back to life. So I'm blogging... I try again tonight, maybe it's a temperature problem. Or maybe a disk thing? All I hope is to get my data back. And of course there is no backup for desktop clients within that corporate intranet. For our own machines we use [bacula](http://www.bacula.org/) to backup Windows clients as well as Linux servers. This works great. But only for our machines :( I wish you a great day anyway!
