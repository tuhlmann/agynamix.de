I'm about to (again) check out [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com), a program not unlike MS OneNote. Evernote is availabl ein a free and a Plus edition. <span id="p44">[![Evernote](/img/uploads/2006/05/EN-screenshot-104-front.gif)](http://blog.agynamix.de//?attachment_id=44 "Evernote")</span> Basically it lets you store all kinds of notes in one scroll. It offers a time band, manual categories (which you can attach to notes) or it can aoutomatically categorize stuff. One interesting feature is the ability to create templates for notes. For instance there is a ToDo template, ToDo With Date, Shopping List or Phone Message. It comes with a FireFox plugin (if you use the latest FireFox you need to download the plugin from their website, the one included in the installer is for older versions) that makes it a snap to grab a whole website or just a part of it and make it part of your Evernote scroll. Cool Software!
