Finally!

[![](http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/waterfall-212x300.jpg "Waterfall in Sequoia NP")](http://www.agynamix.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/waterfall.jpg)

Today I'm excited to release a new version of Simidude with some cool new features.

-   **BIG NEW FEATURE**: Well at least I'm excited about this one. The Simidude hotkey support is now available across all supported platforms (Windows (32-bit and 64-bit), Mac (32-bit) and Linux (32-bit and 64-bit)). That means on all platforms you can now use a global hotkey to make the Simidude window and you can use a hotkey to paste the latest Simidude entry (basically "Activate Item" and "CTRL-V" combined). To enable global hotkey support on Mac systems I started an open [source project](https://bitbucket.org/agynamix/ossupport-connector) that does just that.
-   The Simidude tray menu now hold a menu entry "Toggle Clipboard Monitoring"- you can use that to switch clipboard monitoring on or off without the need to navigate to the main window.
-   I upgraded the Simidude installer which does a better job now integrating with the operating system, especially on Non-Windows systems.
-   Fixing minor bugs.

As always, Simidude is available from our download page at <http://www.agynamix.de/products/simidude/download/>. Enjoy, Torsten Uhlmann
