Yesterday I updated the Ubuntu 6 Linux that runs my internet server that mostly serves my web sites. Having done this repeatedly in the past I didn't foresee any problems- which then came around the corner blazingly fast. Today I noticed that my helpdesk at <http://helpdesk.agynamix.de> isn't working while all other sites are. I'm not sure what caused the problem but rest assured that I am working on it. Meanwhile if you have any questions please email me directly at <T.Uhlmann@agynamix.de>. Thanks, Torsten.
