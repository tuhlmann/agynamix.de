One of the hardest things for me, a developer at heart, is thinking about marketing! Luckily there are Guys like [Eric Sink](http://www.ericsink.com/ "Eric Sink") who can provide a bridge between the software world and the marketing world. I'm currently reading his [blog](http://software.ericsink.com/) and are very thankful for the insight tips he gives. One thing that struck me the most was how could I possibly find a good marketing idea which does not just sound great but is also happily accepted by customers. [Read](http://software.ericsink.com/bos/Finding_Product_Idea.html "Finding a Product Idea") about the tips he has to offer.
