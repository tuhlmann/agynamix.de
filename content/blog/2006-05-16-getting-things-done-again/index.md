If you have too many projects hanging or stacking on your desk [this article](http://safarisoftware.typepad.com/mlp_developer_news/gtd/index.html) by Bob Walsh might be of interest for you. He's describing an algorithm to regain focus on the task at hand and not to spread your focus over multiple projects at once. Currently I'm again reading [David Allen's "Getting Things Done"](http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/qid=1147787030/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/302-7597712-0273655). It's not an easy lecture for me but well worth it's time. If you graduate from a "mere" developer (geek) into an entrepreneur all of a sudden a lot more things are in your responsibility. Things you never knew they existed. You need a good mechanism to deal with all those things. GTD (Getting Things Done) is one way.
