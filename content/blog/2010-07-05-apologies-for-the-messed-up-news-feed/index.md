Feedburner sent out a pretty messed up news mail to my subscribers yesterday and I sincerely want to apologize. The problem might have been that I changed the setting of posts in my RSS feeds. That might have caused Feedburner to reset it's internal markers and make it misbehave. So in the end, it's my fault. I hope the problem ist solved with this last message to you folks. I really value your interest in Simidude news and it was not my desire to jeopardize that. So, have a great day, anyway. Torsten. PS: Please let me know if further problems exist.
