Now you can even make money with [Simidude](http://www.simidude.com)! I have partnered with [ShareASale.com](http://www.shareasale.com) to find new ways to bring Simidude to the people. ShareASale is a well respected affiliate system that connects affiliates and product vendors. So if you would like to earn some money by spreading the word about Simidude you can [apply here](http://www.shareasale.com/shareasale.cfm?merchantID=21879). You will go through a registration process with ShareASale. After they have accepted your application (this is to make sure that no one gets betrayed) you can start advertising and selling Simidude through your website. I'm in the process of creating banners and other graphics that will aid you in the process- these will all be available through the ShareASale site. To promote the software you could write reviews on your website and link to Simidude through the links provided by ShareASale to make sure you get your "share form the sale" (nice pun, eh). Again, here is the [link to apply as my affiliate](http://http://www.shareasale.com/shareasale.cfm?merchantID=21879). Thanks for your interest, Torsten.
