I got some trackbacks on Dopus recently which I really do like. I'd like to thank you guys for your nice encouraging words ([here](http://www.simplifiedcomplexity.com/blog/mgalvin/a-complete-self-contained-cross-platform-docbook-toolchain) and I'm sure there are more). I'm curious how many people actively use Dopus?
