I just came across this thorough description about how you can install additional Eclipse plugins without polluting your Eclipse root directory and even use them for multiple Eclipse installations. The article is [here](http://blog.exis.com/colin/archives/2004/12/23/managing-plugins-in-eclipse/trackback/ "Installing Eclipse plugins the smart way"). Thanks Colin.
