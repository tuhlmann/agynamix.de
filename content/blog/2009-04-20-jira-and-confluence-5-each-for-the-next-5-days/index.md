[Balsamiq](http://twitter.com/balsamiq) twittered it first and I'd like to repeat this great offer of Atlassian here: Until Friday, April 24 you can get Jira And Confluence for a price of $5 each for five users. Don't nail me down on the specific time though- Atlassian is to my knowledge an Australian company and I don't know which time zone they use for there offer... Jira is a Java-based Enterprise grade bug tracking system, and Confluence is an Enterprise wiki with every feature in it you could dream of but where afraid to ask. So if you are a startup you may want to take advantage of this great offer: <http://www.atlassian.com/starter/>
